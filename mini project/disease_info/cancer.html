            <h2>What is Cancer?</h2>
            <p>Cancer is a disease where abnormal cells in our body divide in an uncontrolled way, making more abnormal cells. In the UK, more than 331,000 people are diagnosed with cancer each year. The four most common cancers are breast, prostate, lung, and bowel (colorectal). It is estimated that half of us will develop cancer at some point in our lives, but the good news is that there are ways you can reduce your risk.</p>

            <h2>What Causes Cancer?</h2>
            <p>The risk of developing cancer depends on a combination of factors. You can't change some risk factors like your genetics, but other risk factors are linked to lifestyle choices. Lifestyle factors linked to cancer include smoking, overexposure to the sun or sunbeds, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight or obese, and lack of physical activity.</p>

            <h2>Top Tips for Eating A Healthy, Balanced Diet:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to eat meals at regular times during the day.</li>
                <li>Base meals on starchy foods, such as potatoes, rice, pasta, bread, and breakfast cereals, choosing wholegrain or higher fibre versions where possible.</li>
                <li>Just over a third of the food we eat each day should be fruit and vegetables. Aim for at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day (green leafy vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes).</li>
                <li>Avoid or limit foods high in saturated fat and sugars, such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, full-sugar soft drinks, butter, and ice-cream.</li>
                <li>Choose beans, pulses, and other vegetable sources of protein (like tofu), lean meat, poultry, and fish, instead of fatty meat or processed meat products.</li>
                <li>Choose low-fat and low-sugar dairy foods, such as skimmed or semi-skimmed milk and low-fat, unsweetened yogurt.</li>
                <li>Use unsaturated oils, such as vegetable, rapeseed, and olive oils, in cooking but only in small amounts.</li>
                <li>Swap butter for lower fat spreads.</li>
                <li>Try grilling or boiling your food instead of frying it. Cooking in this way will reduce the amount of fat in your food.</li>
                <li>Choose products lower in salt and use less salt in cooking.</li>
                <li>If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation - no more than 14 units per week for both men and women.</li>
                <li>Keep hydrated, try to drink 6-8 glasses of fluid a day.</li>
                <li>Swap sugary soft drinks for those without sugar, such as water, tea, coffee, and diet drinks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Keeping Active!</h2>
            <p>There is good evidence that a healthy, balanced diet based on the Eatwell Guide may help to lower your risk of developing certain cancers.</p>
            <h3>Adult recommendations for physical activity:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week</li>
                <li>Or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week</li>
                <li>Strength exercises two days a week</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You could meet the recommendation by being active for 30 minutes, 5 days a week. But shorter periods of activity also count and more is better than nothing, even if you donâ€™t manage to meet the recommendation.</p>
            <p>There are lots of ways you can achieve this without signing up to a gym! For more ideas and inspiration, see our page on keeping active.</p>
