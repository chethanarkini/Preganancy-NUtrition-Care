            <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>Diabetes occurs when the body cannot control blood sugar properly. High levels of sugar in the blood can cause serious health problems involving the eyes, heart, kidneys, feet, and nerves. There are also short-term complications which include hyperglycaemia, when blood sugar levels are too high, and hypoglycaemia, when blood sugar levels are too low. People with diabetes can lead full and active lives if their condition is controlled. In the UK, it is thought that 3.8 million people over 16 years old have been diagnosed with diabetes. Nearly 1 million are unaware that they have the condition. Eating a healthy diet, exercising, and losing weight (if necessary) can greatly help to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <h2>Key Facts about Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Type 1 and type 2 diabetes happen when the body cannot control blood sugar properly. This can cause serious health complications.</li>
                <li>About 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.</li>
                <li>Type 2 diabetes is linked with obesity.</li>
                <li>Type 2 diabetes can be prevented whereas type 1 diabetes cannot.</li>

            <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>This condition occurs when the body either cannot produce enough insulin (the hormone needed to move sugar from the blood into the body’s cells) or the insulin the body produces is not used properly (known as insulin resistance), leading to sugar build up in the blood. Type 2 diabetes tends to be diagnosed in people aged over 40 years. However, increasingly, the symptoms are being seen in younger adults and even children. Type 2 diabetes is strongly linked with overweight and obesity, although not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. This condition can generally be treated by making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy, varied diet and doing regular physical activity. Sometimes oral medication (such as metformin) and/or insulin are also needed.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>This condition cannot be prevented and occurs when cells in the pancreas that produce insulin have been destroyed by the immune system. In type 1 diabetes there is no insulin and so sugar stays in the blood. This means that people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin (either with an injection or an insulin pump) to help the body use sugar properly and control blood sugar levels. We do not know why the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas become damaged, but it may be triggered by a viral or other infection.</p>

            <h2>Get Active!</h2>
            <p>It is recommended that adults choose activities that include aerobic and strength exercises. The recommended minimum weekly amount of physical activity for adults is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>150 minutes of moderate level aerobic activity. This should raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. Or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, this should make you breathe hard and fast.</li>
                <li>Strength exercises two or more days of the week. This includes yoga, exercises like sit-ups or press-ups or heavy gardening like digging.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You don’t have to join a gym. Walking, dancing, swimming, gardening, golf, bowling, and cycling all count towards physical activity. Activity can be spread out through the day so the small changes you make add up to a lot more activity. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the lift, leave the car at home for small trips, or get off the bus one stop earlier. Even housework can count!</p>

            <h2>13 Tips For Eating A Healthy, Balanced Diet</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Try to eat meals at regular times during the day.</li>
                <li>Base meals on starchy foods, such as potatoes, rice, pasta, bread, and breakfast cereals, choosing wholegrain or higher fibre versions where possible.</li>
                <li>Just over a third of the food we eat each day should be fruit and vegetables. Aim for at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day (green leafy vegetables are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes).</li>
                <li>Avoid or limit foods high in saturated fat and sugars, such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, full-sugar soft drinks, butter, and ice-cream.</li>
                <li>Choose beans, pulses, and other vegetable sources of protein (like tofu), lean meat, poultry, and fish, instead of fatty meat or processed meat products.</li>
                <li>Choose low-fat and low-sugar dairy foods, such as skimmed or semi-skimmed milk and low-fat, unsweetened yogurt.</li>
                <li>Use unsaturated oils, such as vegetable, rapeseed, and olive oils, in cooking but only in small amounts.</li>
                <li>Swap butter for lower-fat spreads.</li>
                <li>Try grilling or boiling your food instead of frying it. Cooking in this way will reduce the amount of fat in your food.</li>
                <li>Choose products lower in salt and use less salt in cooking.</li>
                <li>If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation - no more than 14 units per week for both men and women.</li>
                <li>Keep hydrated, try to drink 6-8 glasses of fluid a day.</li>
                <li>Swap sugary soft drinks for those without sugar, such as water, tea, coffee, and diet drinks.</li>
            </ol>
