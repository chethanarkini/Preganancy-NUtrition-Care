        "question": " What is diabetes?",
        "answer": "\nDiabetes mellitus (also called diabetes) is caused by a problem with insulin. Insulin moves glucose\u00a0out of the blood and into the body's cells where it can be turned into energy. Diabetes that is present before pregnancy is called pregestational diabetes mellitus.\nWhen the body does not make enough insulin or does not respond to it, glucose cannot get into cells and instead stays in the blood. As a result, the level of glucose in the blood increases. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the body and cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision problems, and kidney disease.\n",

        "question": "How can pregestational diabetes affect my pregnancy?",
        "answer": "\nIf your diabetes is not managed well, you are at increased risk of several of the complications associated with diabetes. The following problems can occur in women with diabetes:\n\n\nBirth defects\u2014Birth defects occur in 6 to 12 percent of women with pregestational diabetes. Defects of the heart, brain, spine, and skeleton can occur in the early weeks of pregnancy when these organs are developing.\n\n\nHigh blood pressure\u2014High blood pressure during pregnancy increases the risk of preeclampsia, a serious condition that can lead to seizures and kidney or liver problems in the mother. Preeclampsia also increases the risk of stillbirth.\n\n\nHydramnios\u2014In this condition, there is an increased amount of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. It can lead to preterm labor and delivery.\n\n\nMacrosomia (very large fetus)\u2014The fetus receives too much glucose from the mother and can grow too large. A large fetus can make delivery more difficult. A large fetus also increases the risk of having a cesarean birth. \n\n\n",

        "answer": "\nBabies born to women with pregestational diabetes may have problems with breathing, low glucose levels, and jaundice. Most babies do well after birth, although some may need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

        "answer": "\nTalk with an obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn) or other health care professional. You can schedule a prepregnancy appointment to learn the steps to take before pregnancy that can decrease the risk of problems later.\nYour health care provider can help you get your blood glucose level under control before you become pregnant (if it is not already). Getting your glucose level under control may require changing your medications, diet, and exercise program.\nControlling your glucose level is important because some of the birth defects caused by high glucose levels happen in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy\u2014before you may know you are pregnant.\n",

        "question": "How can my diet affect my pregnancy?",
        "answer": "\nEating a well-balanced, healthy diet is a critical part of any pregnancy because your fetus depends on the food you eat for growth and nourishment. In women with diabetes, diet is even more important. Not eating properly can cause your glucose level to go too high or too low.\nThe number of calories you should consume every day depends on your weight, how far along you are in your pregnancy, your age, and your level of activity. You may want to see a dietitian or diabetes educator to help with planning your meals. In most cases, your meal plan will include eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day and before bedtime.\nDuring your pregnancy, it\u2019s important to watch how much weight you gain. The amount of weight you should gain depends on your weight before pregnancy. If you are a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain 25 to 35 pounds. If you are underweight, you should gain more weight. If you are overweight, you should gain less. Read How much weight should I gain during pregnancy? to learn more.\n",

        "question": "Should I take medications to control my diabetes during pregnancy?",
        "answer": "\nIf you took insulin before pregnancy to control your diabetes, your insulin dosage will usually increase while you are pregnant. Insulin is safe to use during pregnancy and does not cause birth defects. If you used an insulin pump before pregnancy, you will probably be able to continue using the pump. Sometimes you may need to switch to insulin shots.\nIf you normally manage your diabetes with oral medications, your health care professional may suggest a change in your dosage or that you take insulin while you are pregnant.\nYou should also talk with your ob-gyn about taking low-dose aspirin to help reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Having diabetes puts you at high risk of developing preeclampsia, and low-dose aspirin may lower your risk. Don't start taking aspirin on your own without talking with your ob-gyn.

These tests can help your ob-gyn detect possible problems and take steps to manage them.\nA targeted ultrasound exam may be done in the second trimester to check for visible birth defects. Ultrasound exams may be repeated in later weeks to track the fetus's growth.\nOther tests may be done starting at 32 to 34 weeks of pregnancy and repeated in later weeks:\n\n\nKick count\u2014This is a record of how often you feel your fetus move. The usefulness of kick counts in reducing the risk of serious problems is not clear. Some ob-gyns do not use kick counts for this reason.\n\n\nNonstress test\u2014This test records changes in the fetus's heart rate using electronic fetal monitoring.\n\n\nBiophysical profile (BPP)\u2014This test uses ultrasound to check the fetus's breathing, body movement, muscle tone, and the amount of amniotic fluid. Changes in the fetus's heart rate are also recorded with an electronic fetal monitor.\n\n\nContraction stress test\u2014This test measures the fetus's heart rate in response to contractions of the uterus.\n\n\nRead Special Tests for Monitoring Fetal Well-Being to learn more.\n",

It can help you shed the extra weight that you may have gained during pregnancy, and it causes the uterus to return more quickly to its prepregnancy size.\nIf you breastfeed, you will need to eat extra calories every day. Talk with your health care professional about the amount and types of foods that can give you these extra calories. Eating small snacks during the day may be helpful.\n",
