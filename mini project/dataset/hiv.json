    {
        "question": "Why is HIV treatment recommended during pregnancy?",
        "answer": "\nHIV treatment lowers the amount of HIV in the body. Treatment during pregnancy has two goals: 1) to protect your own health, and 2) to help prevent passing HIV to your fetus. Many combinations of anti-HIV medications can be used to manage HIV infection. This is called a \u201cmedication regimen\u201d or a \"drug regimen.\" \n",

    {
        "question": "What is my viral load and why is it important?",
        "answer": "\nYour viral load is the amount of HIV that you have in your body. A high viral load means there is a greater risk of passing HIV to your fetus and a greater risk of you becoming sick. Your viral load should be watched carefully throughout your pregnancy.\nIf you have a low viral load, it is still possible to pass HIV to your fetus.

        "question": "How can I stay healthy after my baby is born?",
        "answer": "\nStaying healthy is the best thing you can do for yourself and your baby. Here are some things you can do to stay healthy: \n\n\n\nContinue getting HIV treatment. Discuss your medication with your ob-gyn or HIV specialist after the baby is born. You can find health care professionals and clinics that focus on treating people with HIV. \n\n\nTake care of your mental health. Having a baby can be a happy time, but it can also be stressful. You may find it harder to take care of yourself after your baby is born. If you are having difficulty taking your medications as directed, or just need some help coping, talk with your partner, family members, friends, or ob-gyn about getting help. \n\n\nChoose a birth control method. It is possible to get pregnant as soon as 4 weeks after giving birth. It is a good idea to think about the birth control you will use after your baby is born. It is important to give yourself enough time between pregnancies. This gives your body a chance to heal. \n\n\nPlan for your next pregnancy, if desired. Before getting pregnant again, see your ob-gyn for a prepregnancy\u00a0check-up. At this visit, you should discuss the anti-HIV medicines you are taking. Learn more about health before pregnancy.\n\n\n",
