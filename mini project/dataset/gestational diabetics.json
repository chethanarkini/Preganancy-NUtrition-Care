        "question": "What is gestational diabetes?",
        "answer": "\nDiabetes mellitus (also called \u201cdiabetes\u201d) is a condition in which too much glucose (sugar) stays in the blood instead of being used for energy. Health problems can occur when blood sugar is too high. Some women develop diabetes for the first time during pregnancy. This condition is called gestational diabetes (GD). Women with GD need special care both during and after pregnancy.\n",
        "answer_tag": "div"
    },
    {
        "question": "What causes GD?",
        "answer": "\nThe body produces a hormone called insulin that keeps blood sugar levels in the normal range. During pregnancy, higher levels of pregnancy hormones can interfere with insulin. Usually the body can make more insulin during pregnancy to keep blood sugar normal. But in some women, the body cannot make enough insulin during pregnancy, and blood sugar levels go up. This leads to GD.\n",

    {
        "question": "If I develop GD, will I always have diabetes?",
        "answer": "\nGD goes away after childbirth, but women who have had GD are at higher risk of developing diabetes later in life. Some women who develop GD may have had mild diabetes before pregnancy and not known it. For these women, diabetes does not go away after pregnancy and may be a lifelong condition.\n",

    {
        "question": "What are the risk factors for GD?",
        "answer": "\nSeveral risk factors are linked to GD, including\n\n\nbeing overweight or obese\n\n\nbeing physically inactive\n\n\nhaving GD in a previous pregnancy\n\n\nhaving a very large baby (9 pounds or more) in a previous pregnancy\n\n\nhaving high blood pressure\n\n\nhaving a history of heart disease\n\n\nhaving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n\n\nGD also can develop in women who have no risk factors.\n",

    },
    {
        "question": "How can GD affect a pregnant woman?",
        "answer": "\nWhen a woman has GD, her body passes more sugar to her fetus than it needs. With too much sugar, her fetus can gain a lot of weight. A large fetus (weighing 9 pounds or more) can lead to complications for the woman, including:\n\n\nlabor difficulties\n\n\ncesarean birth\n\n\nheavy bleeding after delivery\n\n\nsevere tears in the vagina or the area between the vagina and the anus with a vaginal birth\n\n\n",

    {
        "question": "What other conditions can a woman with GD develop?",
        "answer": "\nWhen a woman has GD, she also may have other conditions that can cause problems during pregnancy. For example, high blood pressure is more common in women with GD. High blood pressure during pregnancy can place extra stress on the heart and kidneys.\nPreeclampsia also is more common in women with GD. If preeclampsia occurs during pregnancy, the fetus may need to be delivered right away, even if it is not fully grown.\n",

    {
        "question": "How can GD affect a baby?",
        "answer": "\nBabies born to women with GD may have problems with breathing and jaundice. These babies may have low blood sugar at birth.\nLarge babies are more likely to experience birth trauma, including damage to their shoulders, during vaginal delivery. Large babies may need special care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There also is an increased risk of stillbirth with GD.\n",

    },
    {
        "question": "Will I be tested for GD?",
        "answer": "\nAll pregnant women should be screened for GD. Your obstetrician\u2013gynecologist (ob-gyn)\u00a0should ask about your medical history to determine whether you have risk factors for GD. If you have risk factors, your blood sugar will be tested early in pregnancy. If you do not have risk factors or your testing does not show you have GD early in pregnancy, your blood sugar will be measured between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n",

    {
        "question": "If I have GD during pregnancy, how will I manage it?",
        "answer": "\nYou will need more frequent prenatal care visits to monitor your health and your fetus\u2019s health. You will need to track your blood sugar and do things to keep it under control. Doing so will reduce the risks to both you and your fetus. For many women, a healthy diet and regular exercise will control blood sugar. Some women may need medications to help reach normal blood sugar levels even with diet changes and exercise.\n",

    },
    {
        "question": "How do I track blood sugar levels?",
        "answer": "\nYou will use a glucose meter to test your blood sugar levels. This device measures blood sugar from a small drop of blood. Keep a record of your blood sugar levels and bring it with you to each prenatal visit. Blood sugar logs also can be kept online, stored in phone apps, and emailed to your ob-gyn. Your blood sugar log will help your ob-gyn provide the best care during your pregnancy.\n",

    {
        "question": "Should I change my diet if I have GD?",
        "answer": "\nWhen women have GD, making healthy food choices is even more important to keep blood sugar levels from getting too high. If you have GD, you should eat regular meals throughout the day. You may need to eat small snacks as well, especially at night. Eating regularly helps avoid dips and spikes in your blood sugar level. Often, three meals and two to three snacks per day are recommended.\nAlso, it is important to gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy. Talk with your ob-gyn about how much weight gain is best for your pregnancy. For a woman with GD, too much weight gained or weight gained too quickly can make it harder to keep blood sugar levels under control.\n",

    {
        "question": "Will regular exercise help me control GD?",
        "answer": "\nExercise helps keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. You and your ob-gyn can decide how much and what type of exercise is best for you. In general, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 5 days a week is recommended (or a minimum of 150 minutes per week). Walking is a great exercise for all pregnant women. In addition to weekly aerobic exercise, it\u2019s a good idea to add a walk for 10 to 15 minutes after each meal. This can lead to better blood sugar control.\n",

    {
        "question": "Will I need to take medication to control my GD?",
        "answer": "\nFor some women, medications may be needed to manage GD. Insulin is the recommended medication during pregnancy to help women control their blood sugar. Insulin does not cross the placenta, so it doesn\u2019t affect the fetus. Your ob-gyn should teach you how to give yourself insulin shots with a small needle. In some cases, your ob-gyn may prescribe a different medication to take by mouth.\nIf you are prescribed medication, you will continue monitoring your blood sugar levels as recommended. Your ob-gyn should review your glucose log to make sure that the medication is working. Changes to your medication may be needed throughout your pregnancy to help keep your blood sugar in the normal range.\n",

        "question": "Will I need tests to check the health of my fetus?",
        "answer": "\nSpecial tests may be needed to check the well-being of the fetus. These tests may help your ob-gyn detect possible problems and take steps to manage them. These tests may include the following:\n\n\nFetal movement counting (\u201ckick counts\u201d)\u2014This is a record of how often you feel the fetus move. A healthy fetus tends to move the same amount each day. You should contact your ob-gyn if you feel a difference in your fetus\u2019s activity. \n\n\nNonstress test\u2014This test measures changes in the fetus\u2019s heart rate when the fetus moves. The term \u201cnonstress\u201d means that nothing is done to place stress on the fetus. A belt with a sensor is placed around your abdomen, and a machine records the fetal heart rate picked up by the sensor.\n\n\nBiophysical profile (BPP)\u2014This test includes monitoring the fetal heart rate (the same way it is done in a nonstress test) and an ultrasound exam. The BPP checks the fetus\u2019s heart rate and estimates the amount of amniotic fluid. The fetus\u2019s breathing, movement, and muscle tone also are checked. A modified BPP checks only the fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid level.\n\n\n",

        "answer": "\nGD greatly increases the risk of developing diabetes in your next pregnancy and in the future when you are no longer pregnant. One third of women who had GD will have diabetes or a milder form of elevated blood sugar soon after giving birth. Between 15 and 70 percent of women with GD will develop diabetes later in life.\nWomen who have high blood pressure or preeclampsia during pregnancy also are at greater risk of heart disease and stroke later in life.
