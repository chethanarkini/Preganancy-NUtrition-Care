        "question": " What is diabetes?",
        "answer": "\nDiabetes mellitus (also called diabetes) is caused by a problem with insulin. Insulin moves glucose\u00a0out of the blood and into the body's cells where it can be turned into energy. Diabetes that is present before pregnancy is called pregestational diabetes mellitus.\nWhen the body does not make enough insulin or does not respond to it, glucose cannot get into cells and instead stays in the blood. As a result, the level of glucose in the blood increases. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the body and cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision problems, and kidney disease.\n",

The following problems can occur in women with diabetes:\n\n\nBirth defects\u2014Birth defects occur in 6 to 12 percent of women with pregestational diabetes. Defects of the heart, brain, spine, and skeleton can occur in the early weeks of pregnancy when these organs are developing.\n\n\nHigh blood pressure\u2014High blood pressure during pregnancy increases the risk of preeclampsia, a serious condition that can lead to seizures and kidney or liver problems in the mother. Preeclampsia also increases the risk of stillbirth.\n\n\nHydramnios\u2014In this condition, there is an increased amount of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. It can lead to preterm labor and delivery.\n\n\nMacrosomia (very large fetus)\u2014The fetus receives too much glucose from the mother and can grow too large. A large fetus can make delivery more difficult. A large fetus also increases the risk of having a cesarean birth. \n\n\n",

In women with diabetes, diet is even more important. Not eating properly can cause your glucose level to go too high or too low.\nThe number of calories you should consume every day depends on your weight, how far along you are in your pregnancy, your age, and your level of activity. You may want to see a dietitian or diabetes educator to help with planning your meals. In most cases, your meal plan will include eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day and before bedtime.\nDuring your pregnancy, it\u2019s important to watch how much weight you gain. The amount of weight you should gain depends on your weight before pregnancy. If you are a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain 25 to 35 pounds.
